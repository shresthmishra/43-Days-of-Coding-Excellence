# 43 Days of Coding Excellence

This repository archives my journey through the **"43 Days of Coding Excellence,"** a programming challenge initiated by the **PAT Cell of VIT Bhopal** for **Teachers Day '25**.

The challenge involved solving one problem every day for 43 days, helping to build fundamental programming skills while honoring our teachers through consistent practice.

**The challenge was successfully completed on September 5, 2025!** All solutions can be found within this repository.

*Have a great one! Until next time.*
