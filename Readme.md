# Welcome to 43 Days of Coding Excellence!

This is a programming challenge initiated by the **PAT Cell of VIT Bhopal** for **Teachers Day '25**.

The goal is to solve one problem per day for 43 days, helping to build fundamental programming skills while honoring our teachers through consistent practice.

Let's do this!
