### About This Challenge

Welcome! This repository documents my 43-day coding journey as part of the **"43 Days of Coding Excellence"** initiative by the **PAT Cell of VIT Bhopal** for **Teachers Day '25**. 

The challenge involved solving one problem every day for 43 days, helping to build fundamental programming skills while honoring our teachers through consistent practice.
